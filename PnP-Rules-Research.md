# Rules for crafting in 5E [^5], [^6]
NOTES:
- Crafting appears to presume a low-magic setting, making higher-level magic take over a year to scribe properly.
- Crafting in this system has a few different rules available and seems somewhat counterintuitive. Cost of spell scrolls is less than the cost to scribe them, for example. As a result, this system doesn't offer a great scribing rules experiene. It also clashes with the high availability of magic in BG/BG2/IWD
