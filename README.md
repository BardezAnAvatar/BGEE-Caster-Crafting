tl;dr: do what you will with it, credit me (Bardez) for my work on the mod.

Two non-binding requested exceptions:
1. Don't use the wands/potion images contained in this repo for in your mod(s) for Infinity Engine games that _THIS_ mod works on. Why? I don't want the art assets to be used in two places and get confusing. Other engines/games? Go nuts!
1. Don't suck my code into your own mega-overhaul mod. Finding 3 versions of the same feature from the same code base in 3 different mods is both annoying and harmful to the modding community.
