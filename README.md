## Introduction
This mod is an implementation of crafting for casters: scribing scrolls, (and later) brewing potions, and crafting wands

tl;dr: do what you will with it, credit me (Bardez) my work on the mod. Grammarsalad, too.

Once exception: Don't use the wands/potion images for inginity engine mods for games that THIS mod works on. Why? I don't want the art
assets to be used in two places and get confusing. Other games? Go nuts!
