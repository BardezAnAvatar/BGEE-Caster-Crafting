tl;dr: do what you will with it, credit me (Bardez) for my work on the mod.

A few non-binding requested exceptions:
1. Don't use the wands/potion images contained in this repo for in your mod(s) for Infinity Engine games that _THIS_ mod works on. Why? I don't want the art assets to be used in two places and get confusing. Other engines/games? Go nuts!
1. Don't suck my code into your own mega-overhaul mod. Finding 3 versions of the same feature from the same code base in 3 different mods is both annoying and harmful to the modding community.
1. Don't just fork this and take it over. Ask first. Try to keep the repo in its original location.
