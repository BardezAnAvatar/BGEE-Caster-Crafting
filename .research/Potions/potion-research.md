# Some notes on potions

### BAMs
	"Large" BAMS need to be 64x64 max
	Inventory tends to be 32x32

	BG1 had 32x32 for both, but:
		The first cycle had the shadow
			cursor upper left
		Second cycle had no shadow
			Centered cursor

	IWD2 intrpduced 64x64 BAMs



### Approach
I think that since each install will be different, I should make a ton of BAMs (maybe 200) and kind of jumble them up. Then, I can iterate
through all of these as the potion registry is processed.


### Costs
Potions, I think, should take 2x as much gold as the scroll.
Oil of speed costs 500.
Scroll of Haste costs 900
:-/

Fireball 900
Firey burning and explosions cost 500 and 450 each.
