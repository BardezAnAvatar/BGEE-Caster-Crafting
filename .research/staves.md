I think that staves will have multiple abilities, such as stave of fire having fireball, scorcher, etc.

Seems that this is reflected in two wands:
- wand of fire has charges for 2 abilities
- wand of spell striking

I think I want to make staves be more thematic and thus not 100% coverage. Thinking for my "differences" of experience that
staves should be ice/fire/armor/etc.

They would refill on sleep. Not really charges per se.

A smaller set of staves, really.
