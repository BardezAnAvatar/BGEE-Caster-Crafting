There is next to no provided guidance on scroll costs.

What we can observe is for Arcane classes:

| Level | Cost  |
| ----- | ----  |
|   1   |   100 |
|   2   |   200 |
|   3   |   300 |
|   4   |   500 |
|   5   |  1000 |
|   6   |  2000 |
|   7   |  3000 |
|   8   |  5000 |
|   9   | 10000 |

Furthermore, the basic ability to cast spells of the specified level:

| Level | Class Level |
| ----- | ----------- |
|   1   |  1 |
|   2   |  3 |
|   3   |  5 |
|   4   |  7 |
|   5   |  9 |
|   6   | 12 |
|   7   | 14 |
|   8   | 16 |
|   9   | 18 |

There are a bunch of ways I could try to make this work for 2E, but it keeps falling short. I suspect
that the best bet would be: { base scroll level cost } + { { Excess Caster Level } * 50 }
