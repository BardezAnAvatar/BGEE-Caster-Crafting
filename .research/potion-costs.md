# On Potion costs
In 3E, Potions cost 2x what it would cost to make a scroll (in terms of gold). This is because of the utility of potions vs. scrolls.

From Pathfinder:
> The price of a potion is equal to the level of the spell × the creator’s caster level × 50 gp

> The price of a scroll is equal to the level of the spell × the creator’s caster level × 25 gp

So theoretically, I could just take the scroll costs and double them.

A Case study: Potion of Fire resistance. Shows up in-game as costing, roughly, 500 gold. The item file's cost is 400. I can sell it for 200.
The Wizard spell Protection from Fire (SPWI319) is level 3, required caster level of 5.
3 x 5 x 50 = 750

In my scroll costs, a level 3 spell costs 300, which doubled would be 600. (amusingly, the potion lasts 2 hours, the spell 1 turn/lvl)


Potion of healing: costs 96 in game; price 75 in ITM. cost for a potion would be 50 (1x1x50). Scroll of 100 would cost 200. So this doesn't seem quite right.

It _is_ close enough though. And if I double the cost of a level 10 spell, that's 40k gold for a 10th level potion. Why not?

OTOH: What if I tier potion costs? say... 1-20?

| ----- | ----  |
|   1   |    50 |
|   2   |   100 |
|   3   |   200 |
|   4   |   300 |
|   5   |   500 |
|   6   |   750 |
|   7   |  1000 |
|   8   |  2000 |
|   9   |  3000 |
|   10  |  4000 |
|   11  |  5000 |
|   12  |  7500 |
|   13  | 10000 |
|   14  | 15000 |
|   15  | 20000 |
|   16  | 30000 |
|   17  | 40000 |
|   18  | moar |
|   19  | moar |
|   20  | moar |

... I could just assign an arbitrary tier to the potion based on perceived value, charge that and go. Brewing would cost half that, non?

I like this approach.
