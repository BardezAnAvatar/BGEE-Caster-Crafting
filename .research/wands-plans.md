Wands really feel 1:1 with spells like scrolls.

Exceptions:
- wand of fire has charges for 2 abilities
- wand of spell striking

Extent

Wands in 3E are 4th level or lower.

Compare to BG base game:
| Wand              |  Effects      | Matching Spells   | Level | Magnitude |
| ---------         | ---------     | ---------------   | ----- | --------  |
| Fear              |  Fear         | Horror            | 2     | 15 rnd    |
| Magic Missiles    | MM            | Magic Missile     | 1     | 1 proj.   |
| Paralysis         | Stun          | Hold PErson       | 3     | 1 trn.    |
| Fire              | FB, AS        | FB, AS            | 2, 3  | 6d6       |
| Frost             | AS Cold       | n/a               | 2-ish | 8d6       |
| Lightning         | bolt          | Lightning Bolt    | 3     | 6d6       |
| Sleep             | sleep         | Sleep             | 1     | 2 trn.    |
| Polymorphing      | poly          | Polymorph Other   | 4     | squirrel  |
| Summon Monster    | SM            | SM2, I think      | 4     | 12 HD, 2 trn |
| Heavens           | Fire pillar   | Flamestrike       | 5     | 8d6       |
| Cloudkill         | CC            | Cloudkill         | 5     |           |
| Spell Striking    | Breach, SS    | Breach, SS        | 5x 6  |           |
| Cursing           | Blind/deaf/silence | blind / silecne | 1/2/3 | 1 turn |


So in BG2, wands go up to 5 or 6 in power. I could cap them at level 6 or lower for EEs, 4 or lower for IWD2.

Or I could say Fuck It and we have wands to Time Stop.

| Magic Missile     |  5000 |
| Paralyzation      | 12500 |

In-Game from Thalantyr (18 Charisma)
| Sleep             |  1905 | 20 charges
| Fear              |  2540 | 20 charges


Soooo
| Fear              | 10000 | 20    | 100
| Sleep             |  7500 | 20    | 100

{ Cost(fear) } = 10000 x (20/100) * 150% * 85%


The formula given in 3.5e, wand price = spell level * caster level * 750.
So the Wand of Fire would cost 3 * 6 * 750 = 13500 before shop markup.


Wands have a price in the ITM file that is for 100 charges (I think), but realistically "100%"
