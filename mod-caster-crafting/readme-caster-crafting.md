## Components

### Scribe tools
This component adds in scribe tools, allowing you to make scrolls, copy spells between spellbooks, or both.

#### Items
New item added by this component:
`BZMSCST`, "Scribe's Tool Kit"
This is a dialog-able item, through which the party member holding the item can copy spells from other party members
and/or scribe scrolls. It is added to varrious stores around magic, libraries, and the ilk.

#### Options
##### Copy Spells
This component will allow any spellbook-based caster to copy spells from another spellbook-based caster;
that would be bards and wizards in 2E. Spells' exclusion flags are honored, so Bards shouldn't get wild mage spells,
and opposition schools should not be copyable to forbidden kits.

##### Scribe Scrolls
This component will allow any caster to write spell scrolls for spells that they know (and exist in the game).
This gives casters a bit more utility, having a repertoire of spells at their fingertips rather than having to memorize
Just The Right Spellsâ„¢ at any given time. It also will allow scrolls to be used for more than just scribbling into a spellbook
due to making any given spell more available.


## Dedication
This mod is dedicated to my wife, Shannon; my daughters Evelyn, Madelyn, and Elliana. These are my support in my daily life.
I'm up after hours working on this while they all sleep, and _maybe_ doing fewer chores than I otherwise should, so I thank
them for tolerating my hobby.

I _prefer_ that this mod does not get sucked into larger mods, like caster overhauls and the ilk.

tl;dr: do what you will with it, credit me (Bardez) for starting the mod.
