Several potions do not work "out of the box" as I would expect:

- [X] Bless: affects party
- [] Entangle does nothing
- [X] Chant: affects party
- [X] Remove Fear: affects party
- [] Mirror Image targeting someone else: affects caster
- [] Strength of one: affects party
- [] Ghost armor oil: affects caster, not target
- [] Oil of fireshield (both blue/red): affect caster, not target
- [] Oil of minor globe of invulnerability: affects caster, not target
- [] Oil of phantom blade: affects caster, not target
- [] Oil of Minor spell Turning: affects caster, not target
- [] Wondrous Recall has no effect at all? just animation? on a bard
- [] Oil of globe of invulnerability: affects caster, not target
- [] Nature's Beauty: has no effect on target or caster

Fixes:
    - Bless: remove projectile
    - Chant: remove projectile
    - Remove Fear: remove projectile
