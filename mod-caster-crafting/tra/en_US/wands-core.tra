Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.

@60076 = ~This wand causes all of the wielder's opponents to ignore <PRO_HISHER> existence as if <PRO_HESHE> were invisible. While protected by this spell, the subject cannot take direct offensive action without breaking the spell, but may use non-attack spells or otherwise act in any way that does not violate the prohibition against offensive action. This allows a warded person to heal wounds, for example, or to Bless <PRO_HIMHER>self. The wielder cannot cast spells on other creatures without ending the spell.
