Wands are powered by charges, each use costing one or more charges (depending on the item). When a wand runs out of charges, it is consumed and destroyed.

@63003 = ~Intended for use during combat, this wand dispels the magical effects upon any enemies within the area. This includes effects given from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items. The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by this wand's caster level (%caster_level%) and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that this wand's caster level (%caster_level%) exceeds the original protection's caster level, the chance of success increases by 5%; conversely, for every level that it falls below, the chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the target is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.

Thus, a difference of +10 levels higher than the magic it is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly, if the caster level is 4 levels lower than the magic the wielder is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success.

The wielder also gains the physical mode of locomotion and breathing as well. This spell does not give the new form's other abilities, such as special attacks and magic, nor does it run the risk of the wielder changing personality and mentality.

//Minor Sequencer
@64042 = ~Wand of Minor Sequencer~
@64043 = ~Once activated, this wand takes the magical energy of the wielder and stores two spells to activate them both at the same time from <PRO_HISHER> Special Ability button. Both spells must be of 2nd level or lower. To create a sequencer, the wielder must memorize the spells <PRO_HESHE> intends to store in it (a Sorcerer can store spells of any level for which <PRO_HESHE> still has spell slots). After casting Minor Sequencer, the player will be prompted to choose the sequenced spells from those <PRO_HESHE> has memorized.

A sequencer lasts until activated and, once used, releases its spells immediately (no casting time). The Special Ability icon also disappears until the next time a sequencer is formed. A character can possess only one Minor Sequencer at a time, and it may not be given to other characters.

//Wizard Eye
@64054 = ~Wand of Wizard Eye~
@64055 = ~Once activated, this wand creates an invisible sensory organ that sends the wielder visual information. This eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas. The eye can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. It has substance and a form that can be detected (by a Detect Invisibility spell, for instance). Solid barriers prevent the passage of the eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The wielder is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic cast on the wielder or eye ends the spell.
