The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by this wand's caster level (%caster_level%) and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that this wand's caster level (%caster_level%) exceeds the original protection's caster level, the chance of success increases by 5%; conversely, for every level that it falls below, the chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure.

Furthermore, the rate at which these creatures regenerate or suffer damage from poison is halved. At the instant the spell is completed, all hostile creatures in 30 foot radius of a point selected by the caster will be affected (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). It negates the effects of a Haste spell, but does not otherwise affect magically speeded or slowed creatures. This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic.

If the caster harms, or attempts to harm, the charmed creature by some overt action, or if a dispel magic spell is successfully cast upon the charmed creature, the charm spell is broken. If two or more charm effects simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent charm takes precedence.

Until dispelled or disbelieved, the armor sets the recipient's base armor class to 2. This spell will not function with any other form of magical armor, but it is cumulative with dexterity bonuses and, in the case of fighter/mages, with the shield bonus. The ghost armor does not hinder movement, adds no weight or encumbrance, nor does it prevent spellcasting. A favourite among mage/thieves, the ghostly nimbus of light which surrounds the recipient grants +20% bonus to Hide in Shadows.

//Dispel Magic
@93048 = ~Wand of Dispel Magic~
@93049 = ~With targeting this wand, it removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the caster level of wand (%caster_level%) and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every caster level that Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic it is trying to dispel, its chance of success increases by 5%. For every caster level that Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic it attempts to dispel, its chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if Dispel Magic is 10 caster levels higher than the magic it is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster level is 4 levels lower than the magic it is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the wand's caster level.

Items dropped or put down by the invisible creature become visible, items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn by the creature. Of course, the invisible creature is not magically silenced, and certain other conditions can render the creature detectable.

The invisibility remains in effect until it is magically broken or dispelled. Subtle hints —a shimmering— allow an observant opponent to attack the invisible spell recipient; these traces are only noticeable when specifically looked for (after the invisible character has made <PRO_HISHER> presence known†). The caster can, however, cast defensive spells on <PRO_HIMHER>self and fellow party members.

Note: After taking revealing action, the wielder is no longer completely invisible. Once the character has revealed himself, opponents can attempt to attack <PRO_HIMHER> with conventional weapons, though they do so with a -4 penalty to the attack roll, or they may cast area of effect spells near <PRO_HISHER> position.

This particular version of the spell will transform the recipient into a squirrel unless a save vs. polymorph is made successfully. The effectiveness of this spell is dependent upon the target's level, with weak creatures being relatively easy to transmute and more powerful creatures being very difficult. Creatures with less than 8 HD/levels save at a -3 penalty, those with 8 - 14 HD/levels save normally, and those with 15 or more HD/levels save with a +3 bonus.
