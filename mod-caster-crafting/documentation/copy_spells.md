# Copy Spells
This component will allow any spellbook-based caster to copy spells from another spellbook-based caster;
that would be bards and wizards in 2E. Spells' exclusion flags are honored, so Bards shouldn't get wild mage spells,
and opposition schools should not be copyable to forbidden kits.

This component _should_ honor the spell levels of each class; Bards can copy level 6 or lower spells from Mages, and Mages can copy
level 6 or lower spells from Bards, level 10 or less from other Mages.

Sorcerers cannot copy spells, since they use magic innately.
